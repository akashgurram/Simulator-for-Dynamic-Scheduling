Please do the following to generate the output in result.txt
Note: 1. The programming language that I have used is python (version 3.8.0)
      2. To generate the output in the format needed, I have used a python package called Tabulate (Installation instructions below)

1. In the directory that contains all the files viz., inst.txt, reg.txt, config.txt, data.txt, simulator.py, utils.py, open the linux terminal (Assuming a linux machine)

2. Make sure that you have python 3.6 or higher.

3. Install pip3 using the following command "sudo apt-get install python3-pip"

4. Install tabulate using the following command "pip3 install tabulate"

5. Once all these commands are run and python and tabulate are installed, we need to run the makefile.

6. Make sure that the inst.txt, config.txt, reg.txt, data.txt and makefile are in the same directory as both the python files (simulator.py and utils.py). 

7. Replace the inst.txt, config.txt, reg.txt, data.txt files with the test files.

8. Then use the following command to execute the project "make run"

9. Please find the result in "result.txt"
